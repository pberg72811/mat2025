Psalm  1

[PSALM 1: 1] How blessed is the man who does not walk in the councel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners, not sit the the seat of scoffers!

[PSALM 1: 2] But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and in His law he meditates day and night.

[PSALM 1: 3] He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, which yields it fruit in its season and its leaf does not wither; and in whatever he does, he prospers.

[PSALM 1: 4] The wicked are not so, but they are like chaff which the wind drives away.

[PSALM 1: 5] Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

[PSALM 1: 6] For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

Psalm 97

[PSALM97: 1] The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; Let the many islands be glad.
 
[PSALM97: 2] Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.

[PSALM97: 3] Fire goes before Him and burns up His adversaries round about.

[PSALM97: 4] His lightnings lit up the world; The earth saw and trembled.

[PSALM97: 5] The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, At the presence of the LORD of the whole earth.

[PSALM97: 6] The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His glory.

[PSALM97: 7] Let all those be ashamed who serve graven images, Who boast themselves of idols; Worship Him, all you gods.

[PSALM97: 8] Zion heard this and was glad, And the daughters of Judah have rejoiced Because of Your judgments, O LORD.

[PSALM97: 9] For You are the LORD Most High over all the earth;  You are exalted far above all gods.

[PSALM97:10] Hate evil, you who love the LORD, Who preserves the souls of His godly ones; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

[PSALM97:11] Light is sown like seed for the righteous And gladness for the upright in heart.

[PSALM97:12] Be glad in the LORD, you righteous ones, And give thanks to His holy name.


Psalm 98

[PSALM98: 1] O sing to the LORD a new song, For He has done wonderful things, His right hand and His holy arm have gained the victory for Him.

[PSALM98: 1] The LORD has made known His salvation; He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.

[PSALM98: 1] He has remembered His loving kindness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel;

[PSALM98: 1] All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

[PSALM98: 1] Shout joyfully to the LORD with the lyre, With the lyre and the sound of melody.

[PSALM98: 1] With trumpets and the sound of the horn Shout joyfully before the King, the LORD.

[PSALM98: 1] Let the sea roar adn all it contains, The world and those who dwell in it.

[PSALM98: 1] Let the rivers clap their hands, Let the moutains sing together for joy.

[PSALM98: 1] Before the LORD, for He is coming to the judge the earth;

[PSALM98: 1] He will judge the world with righteousness

[PSALM98: 1] And the peoples with equity.
