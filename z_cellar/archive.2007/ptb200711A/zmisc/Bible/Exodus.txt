EXODUS CHAPTER 1

[EXO1:1] Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; they came each one with his household:

[EXO1:2] Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;

[EXO1:3] Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;

[EXO1:4] Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

[EXO1:5] And all the persons who came from the loins of Jacob were seventy in number, but Joseph was already in Egypt.

[EXO1:6] And Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.

[EXO1:7] But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly, and multiplied, and became exceedingly mighty, so that the land was filled with them.

[EXO1:8] Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.

[EXO1:9] And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we. 

[EXO1:10] "Come, let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and in the event of war, they also join themselves to those who hate us, and fight against us, and depart from the land."

[EXO1:11] So they appointed taskmasters over them to afflict them with hard labor.  And they built for Pharaoh storage cities, Pithom and Raamses.

[EXO1:12] But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out, so that they were in dread of the sons of Israel.

[EXO1:13] And the Egyptians compelled the sons of Israel to labor rigorously;

[EXO1:14] and they make their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks and at all kinds of labor in the field, all their labors which they rigorously imposed on them.

[EXO1:15] Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah, and the other was named Puah;

[EXO1:16] and he said, "When you are helping the Hebrew women to give birth and see them upon the birthstool if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter she shall live."

[EXO1:17] But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, but let the boys live.

[EXO1:18] So the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and let the boys live?"

[EXO1:19] and the midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and they give birth before the midwife can get them."

[EXO1:20] So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.

[EXO1:21] And it came about because the midwives feared God, that He established households for them.

[EXO1:22] Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every son who is born your are to cast into the Nile, and every daughter you are to keep alive."

EXODUS CHAPTER 2

[EXO2:1] Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi.

[EXO2:2] And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was beautiful, she hid him for three months.

[EXO2:3] But when she could hide him no longer, she got him a wicker basket and covered it over with tar and pitch.  Then she put the child into it, and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile.

[EXO2:4] And his sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.

[EXO2:5] Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, with her maidens walking alongside the Nile; and she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid, and she brought it to her.

[EXO2:6] When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the boy was crying.  And she had pity on him and said, "This is one of the Hebrews children."

[EXO2:7] Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"

[EXO2:8] And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go ahead."  So the girl went and called the child's mother.

[EXO2:9] Then Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I shall give you your wages."  So the woman took the child and nursed him.

[EXO2:10] And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son.  And she named him Moses and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."

[EXO2:11] Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors;  and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.

[EXO2:12] so he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

[EXO2:13] And he went out the next day, and behold two Hebrews were fighting with each other, and he said to the offender, "Why are you striking your companion?"

[EXO2:14] But he said, "Who made you a prince or judge over us?  Are you intending to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?"  Then Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely the matter has become known."

[EXO2:15] When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill Moses.  But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.

[EXO2:16] Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came to draw water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

[EXO2:17] Then the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

[EXO2:18] When they came to Reuel their father, he said, "Why have you come back so soon today?"

[EXO2:19] So they said, "An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds; and what is more, he even drew the water for us and watered the flock."

[EXO2:20] And he said to his daughters, "Where is he then?  Why is it that you have left the man behind?  Invite him to have something to eat."

[EXO2:21] And Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.

[EXO2:22] Then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."

[EXO2:23] Now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died.  And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to God.

[EXO2:24] So God heard their groaning; and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

[EXO2:25] And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them.

EXODUS CHAPTER 3

[EXO3:1] Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness, and come to Horeb, the mountain of God.

[EXO3:2] And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed.

[EXO3:3] So Moses said, "I must turn aside now, and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up."

[EXO3:4] When the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses, Moses!"  And he said, "Here I am."

[EXO3:5] Then He said, "Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."

[EXO3:6] He said also, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."  Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.

[EXO3:7] And the LORD said, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings."

[EXO3:8] "So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite."

[EXO3:9] "And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to Me; furthermore, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them."

[EXO3:10] "Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."

[EXO3:11] But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?"

[EXO3:12] And He said, "Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you; when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain."

[EXO3:13] Then Moses said to God, "Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel, and I shall say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.'  Now they may say to me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say to them?"

[EXO3:14] And God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM"; and He said, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"

[EXO3:15] And God, furthermore, said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.'  This is My name forever, and this is My memorial-name to all generations."

[EXO3:16] "Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt."

[EXO3:17] "So I said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."'

[EXO3:18] "And they will pay heed to what you say; and you with the elders of Israel will come to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.  So now, please , let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.'"

[EXO3:19] "But I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, except under compulsion."

[EXO3:20] "So I will stretch out My hand, and strike Egypt with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go."

[EXO3:21] "And I will grant this people favor the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed."

[EXO3:22] "But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you will put them on yours sons and daughters.  Thus you will plunder the Egyptians."

EXODUS CHAPTER 4

[EXO4:1] Then Moses answered and said, "What if they will not believe me, or listen to what I say?  for they may say, 'The LORD has not appeared to you.'"

[EXO4:2] And the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?"  And he said, "A staff."

[EXO4:3] Then He said, "Throw it on the ground."  So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.

[EXO4:4] but the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand and grasp it by its tail" - so he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand-

[EXO4:5] "that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."

[EXO4:6] And the LORD furthermore said to him, "Now put your hand into your bosom."  so he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow.

[EXO4:7] Then He said, "Put your hand into your bosom again."  so he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it our of his bosom, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.

[EXO4:8] "And it shall come about that if they will not believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe the witness of the last sign."

[EXO4:9] "But it shall be that if they will not believe even these two signs of heed what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground."

[EXO4:10] Then Moses said to the LORD, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since Thou has spoken to Thy servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."

[EXO4:11] And the LORD said to him, "Who has made man's mouth?  Or who makes him dumb of deaf, or seeing or blind?  Is it not I, the LORD?"

[EXO4:12] "Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and teach you what you are to say."

[EXO4:13] But he said, "Please, Lord, now sen the message by whomever Thou wilt."

[EXO4:14] Then the anger of the LORD burned against Moses, and He said, "Is there not your brother Aaron the Levite?  I know that he speaks fluently.  And more over, behold, he is coming out to meet you; when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart."

[EXO4:15] "And you are to speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I even I, will be with your mouth and his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do."

[EXO4:16] "Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; and it shall come about that he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be as God to him."

[EXO4:17] "And you shall take in you hand this staff with which you shall perform the signs."

[EXO4:18] Then Moses departed and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, "Please, let me go, that I may return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive."  And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."

[EXO4:19] Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead."

[EXO4:20] So Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt.  Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.

[EXO4:21] And the LORD said to Moses, "When you go back to Egypt see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go."

[EXO4:22] "Then you shall say to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD, "Israel is My son, My first born."

[EXO4:23] "So I said to you, 'Let My son go, that he may serve Me';  but you have refused to let him go.  Behold, I will kill your son, your first-born."'"

[EXO4:24] Now it came about at the lodging place on the way that the LORD met him and sought to put him to death.

[EXO4:25] Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and threw it at Moses' feet, and said, "You are indeed a bridegroom of blood with me."

[EXO4:26] So He let him alone.  At that time she said, "You are a bridegroom of blood"- because of the circumcision.

[EXO4:27] Now the LORD said to Aaron, "Go to meet Moses in the wilderness."  so he went and met him at the mountain of God, and he kissed him.

[EXO4:28] And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.

[EXO4:29] then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel;

[EXO4:30] and Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses.  He then performed the signs in the sight of the people.

[EXO4:31] so the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about the sons of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed low and worshiped.

EXODUS CHAPTER 5

[EXO5:1] And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let My people go that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.'"

[EXO5:2] But Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go?  I do not know the LORD, and besides, I will not let Israel go."

[EXO5:3] Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us.  Please, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword."

[EXO5:4] But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work?  Get back to your labors!"

[EXO5:5] Again Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!"

[EXO5:6] So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying,

[EXO5:7] "You are no longer to give the people straw to make brick as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves."

[EXO5:8] "But the quota of bricks which they were making previously, you shall impose on them; you are not to reduce any of it.  because they are lazy, therefore they cry out, 'Let us sacrifice to our God.'"

[EXO5:9] "Let the labor be heavier on the men, and let them work at it that they may pay no attention to false words."

[EXO5:10] so the taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, "Thus says Pharaoh, 'I am not going to give you any straw.'

[EXO5:11] 'You go and get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it; but none of your labor will be reduced.'"

[EXO5:12] So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.

[EXO5:13] And the taskmasters pressed them saying, "Complete your work quota, your daily amount, just as when you had straw."

[EXO5:14] Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, "Why have you not completed your required amount either yesterday or today in making brick as previously?"

[EXO5:15] Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?"

[EXO5:16] "There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep saying to us, 'Make bricks!'  And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your own people."

[EXO5:17] But he said, "You are lazy, very lazy; therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'"

[EXO5:18] "So go now and work; for you shall be given no straw, yet you must deliver the quota of bricks."

[EXO5:19] And the foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble because they were told, "You must not reduce your daily amount of bricks."

[EXO5:20] When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them.

[EXO5:21] And they said to them, "May the LORD look upon you and judge you, for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."

[EXO5:22] Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why hast Thou brought harm to this people?  Why didst Thou ever send me?"

[EXO5:23] "Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he has done harm to this people; and Thou has not delivered Thy people at all."

EXODUS CHAPTER 6

[EXO6:1] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he shall let them go, and under compulsion he shall drive them out of his land."

[EXO6:2] God spoke further to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD;

[EXO6:3] and I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them."

[EXO6:4] "And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they sojourned."

[EXO6:5] "And furthermore I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, because the Egyptians are holding them in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant."

[EXO6:6] "Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, 'I am the LORD and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage.  I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.'

[EXO6:7] 'Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.'

[EXO6:8] 'And I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give it to you for a possession; I am the LORD.'"

[EXO6:9] So Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of their despondency and cruel bondage.

[EXO6:10] Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO6:11]  "Go tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the sons of Israel go out of his land."

[EXO6:12] But Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, "Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?"

[EXO6:13] Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

[EXO6:14] These are the heads of their fathers' households.  The sons of Reuben, Israel's first-born: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.

[EXO6:15] And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.

[EXO6:16] And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the length of Levi's life was one hundred and thirty seven years.

[EXO6:17] The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.

[EXO6:18] And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the length of Kohath's life was one hundred and thirty-three years.

[EXO6:19] And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.  These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.

[EXO6:20] And Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the length of Amram's life was one hundred and thirty-seven years.

[EXO6:21] And the sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.

[EXO6:22] And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.

[EXO6:23] And Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

[EXO6:24] And the sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.

[EXO6:25] And Aaron's son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas.  These are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites according to their families.

[EXO6:26] It was the same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts."

[EXO6:27] They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing out the sons of Israel from Egypt; it was the same Moses and Aaron.

[EXO6:28] Now it came about on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,

[EXO6:29] that the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the LORD: speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."

[EXO6:30] But Moses said before the LORD, "Behold, I am unskilled in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me?"

EXODUS CHAPTER 7

[EXO7:1] Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet."

[EXO7:2] "You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land."

[EXO7:3] "But I will harden Pharaoh's heart that I may multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt."

[EXO7:4] "When Pharaoh will not listen to you, then I will lay My hand on Egypt, and bring out My host, My people the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments."

[EXO7:5] "And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their midst."

[EXO7:6] So Moses and Aaron did it; as the LORD commanded them, thus they did.

[EXO7:7] and Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.

[EXO7:8] Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron saying,

[EXO7:9] "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Work a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and thrown it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.'"

[EXO7:10] So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.

[EXO7:11] Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also , the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.

[EXO7:12] For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents.  But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.

[EXO7:13] Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

[EXO7:14] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go."

[EXO7:15] "Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and station yourself to meet him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent."

[EXO7:16] "And you will say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness.  But behold, you have not listened until now."'

[EXO7:17] 'Thus says the LORD, "By this you shall know that I am the LORD: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the staff that is in my hand, and it shall be turned to blood."

[EXO7:18]  "And the fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul; and the Egyptians will find difficulty in drinking water from the Nile."'"

[EXO7:19] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their steams, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"

[EXO7:20] So Moses and Aaron did even as the LORD had commanded.  And he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.

[EXO7:21] And the fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile.  And the blood was through all the land of Egypt.

[EXO7:22] But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

[EXO7:23] Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even for this.

[EXO7:24] So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the Nile.

[EXO7:25] And seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.

EXODUS CHAPTER 8

[EXO8:1] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me."

[EXO8:2] "But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite your whole territory with frogs."

[EXO8:3] "And the Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your house and into your bedroom and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls."

[EXO8:4] "So the frogs will come up on you and your people and all your servants."'"

[EXO8:5] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and over the pools , and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"

[EXO8:6] So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

[EXO8:7] And the magicians did the same with their secret arts, making frogs come up on the land of Egypt.

[EXO8:8] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Entreat the LORD that He remove the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to the LORD."

[EXO8:9] And Moses said to Pharaoh, "The honor is yours to tell me: when shall I entreat for you and your servants and your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, that they may be left only in the Nile?"

[EXO8:10] The he said, "Tomorrow." So he said, "May it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like the LORD our God."

[EXO8:11] "And the frogs will depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they will be left only in the Nile."

[EXO8:12] Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to the LORD concerning the frogs which He had inflected upon Pharaoh.

[EXO8:13] And the LORD did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, the courts and the fields.

[EXO8:14] So they piled them in heaps, and the land became foul.

[EXO8:15] But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

[EXO8:16] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike dust of the earth, that it may become gnats through all the land of Egypt.'"

[EXO8:17] And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were gnats on man and beast.  All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt.

[EXO8:18] And the magicians tried with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; so there were gnats on man and beast.

[EXO8:19] Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God."  But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.

[EXO8:20] Now the LORD said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he comes out to the water, and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, "Let MY people go, that they may serve Me."

[EXO8:21] "For if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of insects on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of insects, and also the ground on which they dwell."

[EXO8:22] "But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of insects will be there, in order that you may know that I, the LORD, am in the midst of the land."

[EXO8:23] "And I will put a division between My people and your people.  Tomorrow this sign shall occur."'"

[EXO8:24] Then the LORD did so.  And there came great swarms of insects into the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms of insects in all the land of Egypt.

[EXO8:25] And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God within the land."

[EXO8:26] But Moses said, "It is not right to do so, for we shall sacrifice to the LORD our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians.  If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not then stone us?"

[EXO8:27] "We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us."

[EXO8:28] And Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall no go very far away.  Make supplication for me."

[EXO8:29] Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you, and I shall make supplication to the LORD that the swarms of insects may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh deal deceitfully again in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."

[EXO8:30] So Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.

[EXO8:31] And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of insects from Pharaoh, from his servants an\ from his people; no one remained.

[EXO8:32] But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.

EXODUS CHAPTER 9

[EXO9:1] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and speak to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me."

[EXO9:2] "For if you refuse to let them go, and continue to hold them,

[EXO9:3] behold, the hand of the LORD will come with a very severe pestilence on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks."

[EXO9:4] "But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel."'"

[EXO9:5] And the LORD set a definite time, saying, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land."

[EXO9:6] So the LORD did this thing on the morrow, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the sons of Israel, not one died.

[EXO9:7] And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead.  But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

[EXO9:8] Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take for yourselves handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh."

[EXO9:9] "And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt."

[EXO9:10] So they took soot from a kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast.

[EXO9:11] And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.

[EXO9:12] And the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as the LORD had spoken to Moses.

[EXO9:13] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me."

[EXO9:14] "For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth."

[EXO9:15] "For if by now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut of from the earth."

[EXO9:16] "But, indeed, for this cause I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power, and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth."

[EXO9:17] "Still you exalt yourself against My people by not letting them go."

[EXO9:18] "Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now."

[EXO9:19] "Now therefore send, bring your livestock and what ever you have in the field to safety.  Every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home, when the hail comes down on them, will die."'"

[EXO9:20] The one among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses;

[EXO9:21] but he who paid no regard to the word of the LORD left his servants and his live stock in the field.

[EXO9:22] Now the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that hail may fall on all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."

[EXO9:23] And Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth.  And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt.

[EXO9:24] So there was hail, and fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, very severe, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

[EXO9:25] And the hail struck all that was in the field through all the land of Egypt, both man and beast; the hail also struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.

[EXO9:26] Only in the land of Goshen where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail.

[EXO9:27] Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time; the LORD is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones."

[EXO9:28] "Make supplication to the LORD, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."

[EXO9:29] And Moses said to him, "As soon as I go out of the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD; they thunder will cease, and there will be hail no longer, that you may know that the earth is the LORD's."

[EXO9:30] "But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not fear the LORD God."

[EXO9:31] (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear and the flax was in bud.

[EXO9:32] But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for the ripen late.)

[EXO9:33] So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to the LORD; and the thunder and the hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth.

[EXO9:34] But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

[EXO9:35] And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the LORD had spoken through Moses.

EXODUS CHAPTER 10

[EXO10:1] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of Mine among them,

[EXO10:2] and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your grandson, how I made a mockery of the Egyptians, and how I performed My signs among them; that you may know that I am the LORD."

[EXO10:3] And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me?  Let My people go, that they may serve Me.'

[EXO10:4] 'For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locust into your territory.'

[EXO10:5] 'And they shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one shall be able to see the land.  They shall also eat the rest of what has escaped-- what is left to you from the hail-- and they shall eat every tree which sprouts for you out of the field.'

[EXO10:6] 'Then your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, something which neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day that they came upon the earth until this day.'" And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.

[EXO10:7] And Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us?  Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God.  Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?"

[EXO10:8] So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, "Go serve the LORD your God!  Who are the ones that are going?"

[EXO10:9] And Moses said, "We shall go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for we must hold a feast to the LORD."

[EXO10:10] Then he said to them, "Thus may the LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your little ones go!  Take heed, for evil is in your mind."

[EXO10:11] "Not so!  Go now, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you desire."  So they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

[EXO10:12] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every plant of the land, even all that the hail has left."

[EXO10:13] So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD directed an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

[EXO10:14] And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt; they were very numerous.  There had never been so many locusts, nor would there be so many again.

[EXO10:15] For they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left.  Thus nothing green was left on tree or plant of the field through all the land of Egypt.

[EXO10:16] Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron, and he said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you."

[EXO10:17] "Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and make supplication to the LORD your God, that He would only remove this death from me."

[EXO10:18] And he went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the LORD.

[EXO10:19] So the LORD shifted the wind to a very strong west wind which took up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.

[EXO10:20] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.

[EXO10:21] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt."

[EXO10:22] So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.

[EXO10:23] They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.

[EXO10:24] Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Even your little ones may go with you."

[EXO10:25] But Moses said, "You must let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God."

[EXO10:26] "Therefore, our livestock, too, will, go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the LORD our God.  And  until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the LORD."

[EXO10:27] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.

[EXO10:28] Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me!  Beware, do not see my face again, for in the day you see my face you shall die!"

[EXO10:29] And Moses said, "You are right: I shall never see your face again!"

EXODUS CHAPTER 11

[EXO11:1] Now the LORD said to Moses, "One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt: after that he will let you go from here.  When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely."

[EXO11:2] "Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold."

[EXO11:3] And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.  Furthermore, the man Moses himself was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, both in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.

[EXO11:4] And Moses said, "Thus says the LORD, 'About midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt,

[EXO11:5] and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of the Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the first-born of the slave girl who is behind the millstone; all the first-born of the cattle as well.'

[EXO11:6] 'Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again.'

[EXO11:7] 'But against any of the sons of Israel a dog shall not even bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.'"

[EXO11:8] "And all these your servants will come down to me and bow themselves before me, saying, 'Go out, you and all the people who follow you,' and after that I will go out."  And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

[EXO11:9] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders will be multiplied in the land of Egypt."

[EXO11:10] And Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land.

EXODUS CHAPTER 12

[EXO12:1] Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,

[EXO12:2] "This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year to you."

[EXO12:3] "Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers' households, a lamb for each household.'

[EXO12:4] 'Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to take one according to the number of persons in them; according to what each man should eat, you are to divide the lamb.'

[EXO12:5] 'Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.'

[EXO12:6] 'And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight.'

[EXO12:7] 'Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.'

[EXO12:8] 'And they shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.'

[EXO12:9] 'Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but rather roasted with fire, both its head and its legs along with its entrails.'

[EXO12:10] 'And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire.'

[EXO12:11] 'Now you shall eat it in this manner; with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste-- it is the LORD's Passover.'

[EXO12:12] 'For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments--I am the LORD.'

[EXO12:13] 'And the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.'

[EXO12:14] 'Now this day will be a memorial to you and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.'

[EXO12:15] 'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.'

[EXO12:16] 'And on the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person, that alone may be prepared by you.'

[EXO12:17] 'You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.'

[EXO12:18] 'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.'

[EXO12:19] 'Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is an alien or a native of the land.'

[EXO12:20] 'You shall not eat anything leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.'"

[EXO12:21] Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Go and take for yourselves lambs according to your families, and slay the Passover lamb."

[EXO12:22] "And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning."

[EXO12:23] "For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you."

[EXO12:24] "And you shall observe this event as an ordinance for you and your children forever."

[EXO12:25] "And it will come about when you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, that you shall observe this rite."

[EXO12:26] "And it will come about when your children will say to you, 'What does this rite mean to you?'

[EXO12:27] that you will say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but spared our homes.'"  And the people bowed low and worshiped.

[EXO12:28] Then the sons of Israel went and did so; just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.

[EXO12:29] Now it came about at midnight that the LORD struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born cattle.

[EXO12:30] And Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead.

[EXO12:31] Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, worship the LORD, as you have said."

[EXO12:32] "Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and bless me also."

[EXO12:33] And the Egyptians urged the people to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We shall all be dead."

[EXO12:34] So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls bound up in the clothes on their shoulders.

[EXO12:35] Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;

[EXO12:36] and the LORD had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request.  Thus they plundered the Egyptians.

[EXO12:37] Now the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children.

[EXO12:38] And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.

[EXO12:39] And they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread.  For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves

[EXO12:40] Now the time that the sons of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.

[EXO12:41] And it came about at the end of four hundred and thirty years to the very day, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

[EXO12:42] It is a night to be observed fro the LORD for having brought them out from the land of Egypt; this night is for the LORD to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.

[EXO12:43] And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat of it;

[EXO12:44] but every man's slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then  he may eat of it."

[EXO12:45] "A sojourner or a hired servant shall not eat of it."

[EXO12:46] "It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it."

[EXO12:47] "All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this."

[EXO12:48] "But if a stranger sojourns with you, and celebrates the Passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land.  But no uncircumcised person may eat of it."

[EXO12:49] "The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who sojourns among you."

[EXO12:50] Then all the sons of Israel did so; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.

[EXO12:51] And it came about on that same day that the LORD brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.

EXODUS CHAPTER 13

[EXO13:1] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO13:2] "Sanctify to Me every first-born, the first offspring of every womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and beast; it belongs to Me."

[EXO13:3] And Moses said to the people, "Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery; for by a powerful hand the LORD brought you out from this place.  And nothing leavened shall be eaten."

[EXO13:4] "On this day in the month of Abib, you are about to go forth."

[EXO13:5] "And it shall be when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall observe this rite in this month."

[EXO13:6] "For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD."

[EXO13:7] "Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen among you in all your borders."

[EXO13:8] "And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'"

[EXO13:9] "And it shall serve as a sign to you on your hand, and as a reminder on your forehead, that the law of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt."

[EXO13:10] "Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year."

[EXO13:11] "Now it shall come about when the LORD brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,

[EXO13:12] that you shall devote to the LORD the first offspring of every womb, and the first offspring of every beast that you own; the males belong to the LORD."

[EXO13:13] "But every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, then you shall beak its neck; and every first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem."

[EXO13:14] "And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' then you shall say to him, 'With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.'

[EXO13:15] 'And it came about, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the LORD killed every first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man and the first-born of beast.  Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD the males, the first offspring of every womb, but every first-born of my sons I redeem.'"

[EXO13:16] "So it shall serve as a sign on your hand, and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt."

[EXO13:17] Now it came about when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was near; for God said, "Lest the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt."

[EXO13:18] Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land of Egypt.

[EXO13:19] And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had make the sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, "God shall surely take care of you; and you shall carry my bones from here with you."

[EXO13:20] Then they set out from Succoth and camped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.

[EXO13:21] And the LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night.

[EXO13:22] He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

EXODUS CHAPTER 14

[EXO14:1] Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO14:2] "Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea."

[EXO14:3] "For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, 'They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'"

[EXO14:4] "Thus I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will chase after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD."  And they did so.

[EXO14:5] When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"

[EXO14:6] So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him;

[EXO14:7] and he took six hundred select chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.

[EXO14:8] And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons of Israel as the son of Israel were going out boldly.

[EXO14:9] Then the Egyptians chased after them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.

[EXO14:10] And as Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel looked, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the LORD.

[EXO14:11] Then they said to Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness?  Why have you dealt with us in this way, bringing us out of Egypt?"

[EXO14:12] "Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians'?  For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."

[EXO14:13] But Moses said to the people, "Do not fear!  Stand by and see the salvations of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever."

[EXO14:14] "The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent."

[EXO14:15] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to Me?  Tell the sons of Israel to go forward."

[EXO14:16] "And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out you hand over the sea and divide it, and the sons of Israel shall go through the midst of the sea on dry land."

[EXO14:17] "And as for Me, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them; and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen."

[EXO14:18] "Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen."

[EXO14:19] And the angle of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.

[EXO14:20] So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light a night.  Thus the one did not come near the other all night.

[EXO14:21] Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea back by a string east wind all night, and turned the sea into dry land, so the waters were divided.

[EXO14:22] And the sons of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry land, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

[EXO14:23] Then the Egyptians took up the pursuit, and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.

[EXO14:24] And it came about at the morning watch, that the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of  fire and cloud and brought the army of the Egyptians into confusion.

[EXO14:25] And He caused their chariot wheels to swerve, and He made them drive with difficulty; so the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians."

[EXO14:26] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen."

[EXO14:27] So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to it normal state at daybreak, while the Egyptians were fleeing right into it; then the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

[EXO14:28] And the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even Pharaoh's entire army that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them remained.

[EXO14:29] But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were like a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

[EXO14:30] Thus the LORD save Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

[EXO14:31] And when Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in His servant Moses.

EXODUS CHAPTER 15

[EXO15:1] Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and said, "I will sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea."

[EXO15:2] The LORD is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will praise Him; My father's God, and I will extol Him."

[EXO15:3] "The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is His name.

[EXO15:4] "Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; and the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea."

[EXO15:5] "The deeps cover them; they went down into the depths like a stone."

[EXO15:6] "Thy right hand, O LORD, is majestic in power, Thy right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy."

[EXO15:7] "And in the greatness of Thine excellence Thou dost overthrow those who rise up against Thee; Thou dost send forth Thy burning anger, and it consumes them as chaff."

[EXO15:8] "And at the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up, the flowing waters stood up like a heap; the deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea."

[EXO15:9] "The enemy said 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be gratified against them; I will draw out my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'"

[EXO15:10] "Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters."

[EXO15:11] "Who is like Thee among the gods, O LORD?  Who is like Thee, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?"

[EXO15:12] "Thou didst stretch out Thy right hand, The earth swallowed them."

[EXO15:13] "In Thy lovingkindness Thou has led the people whom Thou hast redeemed; In Thy strength Thou has guided them to Thy holy habitation."

[EXO15:14] "The peoples have heard, they tremble; Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia."

[EXO15:15] "Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; the leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away."

[EXO15:16] "Terror and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of Thine arm they are motionless as stone; until Thy people pass over, O LORD, until the people pass over whom Thou has purchased."

[EXO15:17] "Thou wilt bring them and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, the place, O LORD, which Thou hast made for Thy dwelling, the sanctuary, O LORD, which Thy hands have established."

[EXO15:18] "The LORD shall reign forever and ever."

[EXO15:19] For the horses of Pharaoh with is chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.

[EXO15:20] And Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took the timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.

[EXO15:21] And Miriam answered them, "Sing to the LORD, for He is highly exalted;  the horse and his rider He has hurled into the sea."

[EXO15:22] Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.

[EXO15:23] And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah.

[EXO15:24] So the people grumbled at Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"

[EXO15:25] Then he cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a tree; and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet.  There He made for them a statute and regulation, and there He tested them.

[EXO15:26] And He said, "If you will give earnest heed the the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer."

[EXO15:27] Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters.

EXODUS CHAPTER 16

[EXO16:1] Then they set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.

[EXO16:2] And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.

[EXO16:3] And the sons of Israel said to them, "Would that we had died by the LORD's hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger."

[EXO16:4] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction."

[EXO16:5] "And it will come about on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily."

[EXO16:6] So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel, "At evening you will know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt;

[EXO16:7] and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your grumblings against the LORD; and what are we, that you grumble against us?"

[EXO16:8] And Moses said, "This will happen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for the LORD hears your grumblings which you grumble against Him.  And what are we?  Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD."

[EXO16:9] Then Moses said to Aaron, "Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, 'Come near before the LORD, for He has heard your grumblings.'"

[EXO16:10] And it came about as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.

[EXO16:11] And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,

[EXO16:12] "I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, 'At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"

[EXO16:13] So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.

[EXO16:14] When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.

[EXO16:15] When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What is it?"  For they did not know what it was.  And Moses said to them, "It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat."

[EXO16:16] "This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Gather of it every man as much as he should eat; you shall take an omer apiece according to the number of persons each of you has in his tent.'"

[EXO16:17] And the sons of Israel did so, and some gathered much and some little.

[EXO16:18] When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered much had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered as much as he should eat.

[EXO16:19] And Moses said to them, "Let no man leave any of it until morning."

[EXO16:20] But they did not listen to Moses, and some left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with them.

[EXO16:21] And they gathered it morning by morning, every man as much as he should eat; but when the son grew hot, it would melt.

[EXO16:22] Now it came about on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one.  When all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses,

[EXO16:23] then he said to them, "This is what the LORD meant: Tomorrow is a sabbath observance, a holy sabbath to the LORD.  Bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning."

[EXO16:24] So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and it did not become foul, nor was there any worm in it.

[EXO16:25] And Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field."

[EXO16:26] "Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will be none."

[EXO16:27] And it came about on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.

[EXO16:28] Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions?"

[EXO16:29] "See, the LORD has given you the sabbath; therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day.  Remain every man in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."

[EXO16:30] So the people rested on the seventh day.

[EXO16:31] And the house of Israel named it manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.

[EXO16:32] Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded, 'Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"

[EXO16:33] And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations."

[EXO16:34] As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be kept.

[EXO16:35] And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.

[EXO16:36] (Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.)

EXODUS CHAPTER 17

[EXO17:1] Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of Sin, according to the command of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.

[EXO17:2] Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water that we may drink."  And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me?  Why do you test the LORD?"

[EXO17:3] But the people thirsted there for water; and they grumbled against Moses and said, "Why, now, have you brought us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?"

[EXO17:4] So Moses cried out to the LORD,saying, "What shall I do to this people?  A little more and they will stone me."

[EXO17:5] The the LORD said to Moses, "Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go."

[EXO17:6] "Behold, I will stand before you there on the the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink."  And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

[EXO17:7] And he named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the LORD, saying, "Is the LORD among us, or not?"

[EXO17:8] Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim.

[EXO17:9] So Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out, fight against Amalek.  Tomorrow I will station myself on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand."

[EXO17:10] And Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

[EXO17:11] So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.

[EXO17:12] But Moses' hands were heavy.  Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other.  Thus his hands were steady until the sun set.

[EXO17:13] So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

[EXO17:14] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial, and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."

[EXO17:15] And Moses built an altar, and named it The LORD is My Banner;

[EXO17:16] and he said, "The LORD has sworn; the LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation."

EXODUS CHAPTER 18

[EXO18:1] Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.

[EXO18:2] And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Moses' wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away,

[EXO18:3] and her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."

[EXO18:4] And the other was named Eliezer, for he said, "The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh."

[EXO18:5] Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mount of God.

[EXO18:6] And he sent word to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her."

[EXO18:7] Then Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare, and went into the tent.

[EXO18:8] And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had befallen them on the journey, and how the LORD had delivered them.

[EXO18:9] And Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians.

[EXO18:10] So Jethro said, "Blessed be the LORD who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."

[EXO18:11] "Now I know that the LORD is greater than all the gods; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people."

[EXO18:12] Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses' father-in-law before God.

[EXO18:13] And it came about the next day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood about Moses from the morning until the evening.

[EXO18:14] Now when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this thing that you are doing for the people?  Why do you alone sit as judge and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?"

[EXO18:15] And Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God."

[EXO18:16] "When they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and make known the statutes of God and His laws."

[EXO18:17] And Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you are doing is not good."

[EXO18:18] "You will surely wear out, both yourself and these people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone."

[EXO18:19] "Now listen to me: I shall give you counsel, and God be with you.  You be the people's representative before God, and you bring the disputes to God,

[EXO18:20] then teach them the statues and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they are to walk, and the work they are to do."

[EXO18:21] "Furthermore, you shall select out of all the people able men who fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; and you shall place these over them, as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens."

[EXO18:22] "And let them judge the people at all times; and let it be that every major dispute they will bring to you, but every minor dispute they themselves will judge.  So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you."

[EXO18:23] "If you do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace."

[EXO18:24] So Moses listened to his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.

[EXO18:25] And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens.

[EXO18:26] And they judged the people at all times; the difficult dispute they would bring to Moses, but every minor dispute they themselves would judge.

[EXO18:27] Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and he went his way into his own land.

EXODUS CHAPTER 19

[EXO19:1] In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.

[EXO19:2] When they set out from Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain.

[EXO19:3] And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel:

[EXO19:4] 'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself.'

[EXO19:5] 'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My convenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;

[EXO19:6] and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.'  These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel."

[EXO19:7] So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him.

[EXO19:8] And all the people answered together and said, "All the LORD has spoken we will do!"  And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD.

[EXO19:9] And the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I shall come to you in a thick cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe in you forever."  Then Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.

[EXO19:10] The LORD also said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments;

[EXO19:11] and let them be ready for the third day, for on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."

[EXO19:12] "And you shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.'

[EXO19:13] 'No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live.'  When the ram's horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain."

[EXO19:14] So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated the people, and they washed their garments.

[EXO19:15] And he said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; do not go near a woman."

[EXO19:16] So it came about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people who ere in the camp trembled.

[EXO19:17] And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.

[EXO19:18] Now Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.

[EXO19:19] When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.

[EXO19:20] And the LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain and Moses went up.

[EXO19:21] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish."

[EXO19:22] "And also let the priests who come near to the LORD consecrate themselves, lest the LORD break out against them."

[EXO19:23] And Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for Thou didst warn us, saying, 'Set bounds about the mountain and consecrate it.'"

[EXO19:24] Then the LORD said to him, "Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest He break forth upon them."

[EXO19:25] So Moses went down to the people and told them.

EXODUS CHAPTER 20

[EXO20:1] Then God spoke all these words, saying,

[EXO20:2] "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."

[EXO20:3] "You shall have no other gods before Me."

[EXO20:4] "You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth."

[EXO20:5] "You shall not worship them of serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,

[EXO20:6] but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments."

[EXO20:7] "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain."

[EXO20:8] "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."

[EXO20:9] "Six days you shall labor and do all your work,

[EXO20:10] but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD you God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you."

[EXO20:11] "For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy."

[EXO20:12] "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you."

[EXO20:13] "You shall not murder."

[EXO20:14] "You shall not commit adultery."

[EXO20:15] "You shall not steal."

[EXO20:16] "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."

[EXO20:17] "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor."

[EXO20:18] And all the people perceived the thunder and the lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountains smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.

[EXO20:19] Then they said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen; but let not God speak to us, lest we die."

[EXO20:20] And Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, so that you may not sin."

[EXO20:21] So the people stood at a distance, while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.

[EXO20:22] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.'

[EXO20:23] 'You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.'

[EXO20:24] 'You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.'

[EXO20:25] 'And if you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you wield your tool on it, you will profane it.'

[EXO20:26] 'And you shall not go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.'"

EXODUS CHAPTER 21

[EXO21:1] "Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them."

[EXO21:2] "If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment."

[EXO21:3] "If he comes alone, he shall go out alone; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him."

[EXO21:4] "If his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall go out alone."

[EXO21:5] "But if the slave plainly says, 'I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not go out as a free man,'

[EXO21:6] then his master shall bring him to God, then he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost.  And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him permanently."

[EXO21:7] "And if a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she is not to go free as the male slaves do."

[EXO21:8] "If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.  He does not have authority to sell her to a foreign people because of his unfairness to her."

[EXO21:9] "And if he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters."

[EXO21:10] "If he takes to himself another woman he may not reduce her food, her clothing or her conjugal rights."

[EXO21:11] "And if he will not do these three things for her, then she shall go out for nothing without payment of money."

[EXO21:12] "He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death."

[EXO21:13] "But if he did no lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which  he may flee."

[EXO21:14] "If, however, a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to kill him craftily, you are to take him even from My altar, that he may die."

[EXO21:15] "And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death."

[EXO21:16] "And he who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death."

[EXO21:17] "And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death."

[EXO21:18] "And if men have a quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with his first, and he does not die but remains in bed;

[EXO21:19] if he gets up and walks around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall go unpunished; he shall only pay for his loss of time, and he shall take care of him until he is completely healed."

[EXO21:20] "And if a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished."

[EXO21:21] "If, however, he survives a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken; for he is his property."

[EXO21:22] "And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide."

[EXO21:23] "But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life,

[EXO21:24] eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

[EXO23:30] "I will drive them out before you little by little, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land."

[EXO23:31] "And I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River Euphrates; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you."

[EXO23:32] "You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods."

[EXO23:33] "They shall not live in your land, lest they make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you."

EXODUS CHAPTER 24

[EXO24:1] Then He said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel, and you shall worship at a distance."

[EXO24:2] "Moses alone, however, shall come near to the LORD, but they shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him."

[EXO24:3] Then Moses came and recounted to the people all the words of the LORD and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said "All the words which the LORD has spoken we will do!"

[EXO24:4] And Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD.  Then he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.

[EXO24:5] And he sent young men of the sons of Israel; and they offered burnt offerings to the LORD.

[EXO24:6] And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

[EXO24:7] Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people; and they said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!"

[EXO24:8] So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, "Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words."

[EXO24:9] Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,

[EXO24:10] and they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.

[EXO24:11] Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; and they beheld God, and they ate and drank.

[EXO24:12] Now the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to Me on the mountain and remain there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction."

[EXO24:13] So Moses arose with Joshua his servant, and Moses went up to the mountain of God.

[EXO24:14] But to the elders he said, "Wait here for us until we return to you.  And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him approach them."

[EXO24:15] Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.

[EXO24:16] And the glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.

[EXO24:17] And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like a consuming fire on the mountain top.

[EXO24:18] And Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

EXODUS CHAPTER 25

[EXO25:1] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO25:2] "Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for Me; from every man whose heart moves him you shall raise My contribution."

[EXO25:10] "And they shall construct an ark of acacia wood two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high."

[EXO25:21] "And you shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I shall give to you."

[EXO25:22] "And there I will meet with you; and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak to you about all that I will give you in commandment for the sons of Israel."

[EXO25:23] "And you shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long and one cubit wide and one and a half cubits high."

[EXO25:24] "And you shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold border around it."

[EXO28:14] and two chains of pure gold; you shall make them of twisted cordage work, and you shall put the corded chains on the filigree settings."

[EXO28:15] "And you shall make a breastpiece of judgment, the work of a skillful workman; like the work of the ephod you shall make it: of gold, of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen you shall make it."

[EXO28:16] "It shall be square and folded double, a span in length and a span in width."

[EXO28:17] "And you shall mount on it four rows of stones; the first row shall be a row of ruby, topaz and emerald;

[EXO28:18] and the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond;

[EXO28:19] and the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst;

[EXO28:20] and the fourth row a beryl an onyx and a jasper; they shall be set in gold filigree."

[EXO28:21] "And the stones shall be according to the names of the sons of Israel: twelve, according to their names; they shall be like the engravings of the seal, each according to his name for the twelve tribes."

[EXO28:22] "And you shall make on the breastpiece chains of twisted cordage work in pure gold."

[EXO28:23] "And you shall make on the breast piece two rings of gold, and shall put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece."

[EXO28:24] "And you shall put the two cords of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece."

[EXO28:25] "And you shall put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, at the front of it."

[EXO28:26] "And you shall make two rings of gold and shall place them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on the edge of it, which is toward the inner side of the ephod."

[EXO28:27] "And you shall make two rings of gold and put them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it close to the place where it is joined, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod."

[EXO28:28] "And they shall bind the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, that it may be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and they the breastpiece may not come loose from the ephod."

[EXO28:29] "And Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of Israel in the breastpiece of judgment over his heart when he enters the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually."

[EXO28:30] "And you shall put in the breastpiece of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be over Aaron's heart when he goes in before the LORD; and Aaron shall carry the judgment of the sons of Israel over his hear before the LORD continually."

[EXO28:31] "And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue."

[EXO28:32] "And there shall be an opening at its top in the middle of it; around its opening there shall be a binding of woven work, as it were the opening of the coat of mail, that it may not be torn"

[EXO28:33] "And you shall make on its hem pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material, all around on its hem, and bells of gold between them all around:

[EXO28:34] a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, all around on the hem of the robe."

[EXO28:35] "And it shall be on Aaron when he ministers; and its tinkling may be heard when he enters and leaves the holy place before the LORD, that he may not die."

[EXO28:36] "You shall also make a plate of pure gold and shall engrave on it, like the engravings of a seal, 'Holy to the LORD.'"

[EXO28:37] "And you shall fasten it on a blue cord, and it shall be on the turban; it shall be at the front of the turban."

[EXO28:38] "And it shall be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall take away the iniquity of the holy things which the sons of Israel consecrate, with regard to all their holy gifts; and it shall always be on his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

[EXO28:39] "and you shall weave the tunic of checkered work of fine linen, and shall make a turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash, the work of a weaver."

[EXO28:40] "And for Aaron's sons you shall make tunics; you shall also make sashes for them, and you shall make caps for them, for glory and for beauty."

[EXO28:41] "And you shall put them on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him; and you shall anoint them and ordain them and consecrate them that they may serve Me as priests."

[EXO28:42] "And you shall make for them linen breeches to cover their bare flesh; they shall reach from the loins even to the thighs."

[EXO28:43] "And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they enter the tent of meeting, or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place, so that they do not incur guilt and die.  It shall be a statute forever to him and to his descendants after him."

EXODUS CHAPTER 29

[EXO29:1] "Now this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them to minister as priests to Me; take on young bull and two rams without blemish,

[EXO29:2] and unleavened bread and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil; you shall make them of fine wheat flour."

[EXO29:3] "And you shall put them in one basket, and present them in the basket along with the bull and the two rams."

[EXO29:4] "Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water."

[EXO29:5] "and you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the tunic and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastpiece, and gird him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod;

[EXO29:6] and you shall set the turban on his head, and put he holy crown on the turban."

[EXO29:7] "Then you shall take  the anointing oil, and pour it on his head and anoint him."

[EXO29:8] "And you shall bring his sons and put tunics on them."

[EXO29:9] "And you shall gird them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and bind caps on them, and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute.  So you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.

[EXO29:10] "Then you shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull."

[EXO29:11] "And you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD at the doorway of the tent of meeting."

[EXO29:12] "And you shall take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger; and you shall pour out all the blood at the base of the altar."

[EXO29:13] "And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar."

[EXO29:14] "But the flesh of the bull and its hide and its refuse, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering."

[EXO29:15] "You shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram;

[EXO29:16] and you shall slaughter the ram and shall take its blood and sprinkle it around on the altar."

[EXO29:17] "Then you shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and its head."

[EXO29:18] "And you shall offer up in smoke the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD."

[EXO29:19] "Then you shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram."

[EXO29:20] "And you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear and on the lobes of his sons' right ears and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet, and sprinkle the rest of the blood around on the altar."

[EXO29:21] "Then you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons' garments with him; so he and his garments shall be consecrated, as well as his sons and his sons' garments with him."

[EXO29:22] "You shall also take the fat from the ram and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),

[EXO29:23] and one cake of bread and one cake of bread mixed with oil and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread which is set before the LORD;

[EXO29:24] and you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD."

[EXO29:25] "And you shall take them from their hands, and offer them up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering for a soothing aroma before the LORD; it is an offering by fire to the LORD."

[EXO29:26] "Then you shall take the breast of Aaron's ram of ordination, and wave it as a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be your portion."

[EXO29:27] "And you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering which was waved and which was offered from the ram of ordination, from the one which was for Aaron and from the one which was for his sons.

[EXO29:28] "And it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever from the sons of Israel, for it is a heave offering; and it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to the LORD."

[EXO29:29] "And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, that in them they may be anointed and ordained."

[EXO29:30] "For seven days the one of his sons who is priest in his stead shall put them on when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place."

[EXO29:31] "And you shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place."

[EXO29:32] "And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the doorway of the tent of meeting."

[EXO29:33] "Thus they shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a layman shall not eat them, because they are holy."

[EXO29:34] "And if any of the flesh of ordination or any of the bread remains until morning, they you shall burn the remainder with  fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy."

[EXO29:35] "And thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you ; you shall ordain them through seven days."

[EXO29:36] "And each day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, and you shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it; and you shall anoint it to consecrate it."

[EXO29:37] "For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy."

[EXO29:38] "Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one year old lambs each day, continuously."

[EXO29:39] "The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;

[EXO29:40] and there shall be one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one fourth of a hin of wine for a libation with one lamb."

[EXO29:41] "And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and shall offer with it the same grain offering as the morning and the same libation, for a soothing aroma, and offering by fire to the LORD."

[EXO29:42] "It shall be a continual burn offering throughout your generations at the doorway of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there."

[EXO29:43] "And I will meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be consecrated by My glory."

[EXO29:44] "And I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to minister as priests to Me."

[EXO29:45] "And I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God."

[EXO29:46] "And they shall know that I am the LORD their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them; I am the LORD their God."

EXODUS CHAPTER 30

[EXO30:1] "Moreover, you shall make an altar as a place of burning incense; you shall make it of acacia wood."

[EXO30:2] "Its length shall be a cubit, and its width a cubit, it shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits; its horns shall be of one piece with it."

[EXO30:3] "And you shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding all around for it."

[EXO30:4] "And you shall make two gold rings for it under its molding; you shall make them on its two side walls-on opposite sides-and they shall be holders for poles with which to carry it."

[EXO30:5] "And you shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold."

[EXO30:6] "And you shall put this altar in front of the veil that is near the ark of the testimony, in front of the mercy seat that is over the ark of the testimony, where I will meet with you."

[EXO30:7] "And Aaron shall burn fragrant incense on it; he shall burn it every morning when he trims the lamps."

[EXO30:8] "And when Aaron trims the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense.  There shall be perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.

[EXO30:9] "You shall not offer any strange incense on this altar, or burnt offering or meal offering; and you shall not pour out a libation on it."

[EXO30:10] "And Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year; he shall make atonement on it with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once a year throughout your generations.  It is most holy to the LORD."

[EXO30:11] The LORD also spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO30:12] "When you take a census of the sons of Israel to number them, then each one of them shall give a ransom for himself to the LORD, when you number them, that there may be no plague among them when you number them."

[EXO30:13] "This is what everyone who is numbered shall give: half a shekel according to the the shekel of the sanctuary (then shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a contribution to the LORD."

[EXO30:14] "Everyone who is numbered from twenty years old and over, shall give the contribution to the LORD."

[EXO30:15] "The rich shall not pay more, and the poor shall not pay less then half a shekel, when you give the contribution to the LORD to make atonement for yourselves."

[EXO30:16] "And you shall take the atonement money from the sons of Israel, and shall give it fro the service of the ten of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for yourselves."

[EXO30:17] And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO30:18] "You shall also make a laver of bronze, with its base of bronze, for washing; and you shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it."

[EXO30:19] "And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it;

[EXO30:20] when they enter the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they approach the altar to minister, by offering up in smoke a fire sacrifice to the LORD."

[EXO30:21] "So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die; and it shall be a perpetual statue for them, for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations."

[EXO30:22] "Moreover, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO30:23] "Take also for yourself the finest of spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred and fifty, and of fragrant cane two hundred and fifty,

[EXO30:24] and of cassia five hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin."

[EXO30:25] "And you shall make of these a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil."

[EXO30:26] "And with it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony,

[EXO30:27] and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,

[EXO30:28] and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand."

[EXO30:29] "You shall also consecrate them, that they may be most holy; whatever touches them shall be holy."

[EXO30:30] "And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister as priests to Me."

[EXO30:31] "And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to Me throughout your generations.'

[EXO30:32] 'It shall not be poured on anyone's body, nor shall you make any like it, in the same proportions; it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.'

[EXO30:33] 'Whoever shall mix any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a layman, shall be cut off from his people.'"

[EXO30:34] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Take for yourself spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal part of each."

[EXO30:35] "And with it you shall make incense, a perfume, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure and holy."

[EXO30:36] "And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put part of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I shall meet with you; it shall be most holy to you."

[EXO30:37] "And the incense which you shall make, you shall not make in the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for the LORD."

[EXO30:38] "Whoever shall make any like it, to use as perfume, shall be cut off from his people."

EXODUS CHAPTER 31

[EXO31:1] Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO31:2] "See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."

[EXO31:3] "And I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship,

[EXO31:4] to make artistic designs for work in gold, in silver, and in bronze,

[EXO31:5] and in the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood, that he may work in all kinds of craftsmanship."

[EXO31:6] "And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill, that they may make all that I have commanded you:

[EXO31:7] the tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy seat upon it, and all the furniture of the tent,

[EXO31:8] the table also and its utensils, and the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, and the altar of incense,

[EXO31:9] the altar of burnt offering also with all its utensils, and the laver and its stand,

[EXO31:10] the woven garments as well, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, with which to carry on their priesthood;

[EXO31:11] The anointing oil also, and the fragrant incense for the holy place, they are to make them according to all that I have commanded you."

[EXO31:12] And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO31:13] "But as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'You shall surely observe My sabbaths; for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.'

[EXO31:14] 'Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you.  Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.'

[EXO31:15] 'For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put to death.'

[EXO31:16] 'So the sons of Israel shall observe the sabbath, to celebrate the sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.'"

[EXO31:17] "It is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD make heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased from labor, and was refreshed."

[EXO31:18] And when He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God."

EXODUS CHAPTER 32

[EXO32:1] Now when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron, and said to him, "Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him."

[EXO32:2] And Aaron said to them, "Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."

[EXO32:3] Then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.

[EXO32:4] And he took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and make it into a molten calf; and they said, "This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."

[EXO32:5] Now when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron make a proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD."

[EXO32:6] So the next day they rose early and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play."

[EXO32:7] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves."

[EXO32:8] "They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them.  They have make for themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!'"

[EXO32:9] And the LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this people, and behold,
they are an obstinate people."

[EXO32:10] "Now then let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them, and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you a great nation."

[EXO32:11] Then Moses entreated the LORD his God, and said, "O LORD, why doth Thine anger burn against Thy people whom Thou has brought out from the land of Egypt with great power with a might hand?"

[EXO32:12] Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'?  Turn from Thy burning anger and change Thy mind about doing harm to Thy people."

[EXO32:13] "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants to whom Thou didst swear by Thyself, and didst say to them, 'I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.'"

[EXO32:14] So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He said He would do to His people.

[EXO32:15] Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides; they were written on one side and the other.

[EXO32:16] And the tablets were God's work, and the writing was God's writing engraved on the tablets.

[EXO32:17] Now when Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "There is a sound of war in the camp."

[EXO32:18] But he said, "It is not the sound of the cry of triumph, nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat; but the sound of singing I hear."

[EXO32:19] And it came about, as soon as Moses came near the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses' anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain.

[EXO32:20] And he took the calf which they had made and burned it with fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it over the surface of the water, and made the sons of Israel drink it.

[EXO32:21] Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you, that you have brought such great sin upon them?"

[EXO32:22] And Aaron said, "Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil."

[EXO32:23] "For they said to me, 'Make a god for us who will go before us; for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'"

[EXO32:24] "And I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them tear it off.'  so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."

[EXO32:25] Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control- for Aaron had let them get out of control the be a derision among their enemies-

[EXO32:26] then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!"  And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.

[EXO32:27] And he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Every man of you put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and kill every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor.'"

[EXO32:28] So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people fell that day.

[EXO32:29] Then Moses said, "Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD- for every man has been against his son and against his brother- in order that He may bestow a blessing upon you today."

[EXO32:30] And it came about on the next day that Moses said to the people, "You yourselves have committed a great sin; and now I am going up to the LORD, perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."

[EXO32:31] Then Moses returned to the LORD, and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves."

[EXO32:32] "But now, if Thou wilt, forgive their sin- and if not , please blot me out from Thy book which Thou hast written!"

[EXO32:33] And the LORD said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book."

[EXO32:34] "But go now, lead the people where I told you.  Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."

[EXO32:35] Then the LORD smote the people, because of what they did with the calf which Aaron had made.

EXODUS CHAPTER 33

[EXO33:1] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'To your descendants I will give it.'"

[EXO33:2] "And I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Cannaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite."

[EXO33:3] "Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are an obstinate people, lest I destroy you on the way."

[EXO33:4] When the people heard this sad word, they went into mourning, and none of them put on his ornaments.

[EXO33:5] For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the people; should I go up in your midst for one moment, I would destroy you.  Now therefore, put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what I will do with you.'"

[EXO33:6] So the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.

[EXO33:7] Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting.  And it came about, that everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.

[EXO33:8] And it came about, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he entered the tent.

[EXO33:9] And it came about, whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent; and the LORD would speak with Moses.

[EXO33:10] When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would arise and worship, each at the entrance of his tent."

[EXO33:11] Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend.  When Moeses returned to the camp, his servants Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.

[EXO33:12] Then Moses said to the LORD, "See, Thou dost say to me, 'Bring up this people!' But Thou Thyself has not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me.  Moreover, Thou hast said, 'I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.'"

[EXO33:13] "Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found favor in Thy sight, let me know Thy ways, that I may know Thee, so that I may find favor in Thy sight.  Consider too, that this nation is Thy people."

[EXO33:14] And He said, "My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest."

[EXO33:15] Then he said to Him, "If Thy presence does no go with us do not lead us up from here."

[EXO33:16] "For how then can it be known that I have found favor in Thy sight, I and Thy people?  Is it not by Thy going with us, so that we, I and Thy people, may be distinguished from all the other people who are upon the face of the earth?"

[EXO33:17] And the LORD said to Moses, "I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight, and I have know you by name."

[EXO33:18] Then Moses said, "I pray Thee, show me Thy glory!"

[EXO33:19] And He said, "I myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion."

[EXO33:20] But He said, "You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!"

[EXO33:21] Then the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand there on the rock;

[EXO33:22] and it will come about, while My glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by."

[EXO33:23] "Then I will take My hand away and you shall see My back, but My face shall not be seen."

EXODUS CHAPTER 34

[EXO34:1] Now the LORD said to Moses, "Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets which you shattered."

[EXO34:2] "So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain."

[EXO34:3] "And no man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and the herds may not graze in front of that mountain."

[EXO34:4] So he cut out two stone tablets like the former ones, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and he took two stone tablets in his hand.

[EXO34:5] And the LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with him as he called upon the name of the LORD.

[EXO34:6] Then the LORD passed by in front of him, and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth;

[EXO34:7] who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations."

[EXO34:8] And Moses made haste to bow low toward the earth and worship.

[EXO34:9] And he said, "If now I have found favor in Thy sight, O LORD, I pray, let the Lord go along in our midst, even though the people are so obstinate; and do Thou pardon our iniquity and our sin, and to take us as Thine own possession."

[EXO34:10] Then God said, "Behold, I am going to make a covenant.  Before all your people I will perform miracles which have not been produced in all the earth, nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live will see the working of the LORD, for it is a fearful thing that I am going to perform with you."

[EXO34:11] Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizite, the Hivite and the Jebusite."

[EXO34:12] "Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, lest it become a snare in your midst."

[EXO34:13] "But rather, you are to tear down their altars and smash their sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim

[EXO34:14] -for you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God-

[EXO34:15] lest you  make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they play the harlot with their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and someone invite you to eat of his sacrifice;

[EXO34:16] and you take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters play the harlot with their gods, an cause your sons also to play the harlot with their gods."

[EXO34:17] "You shall make for yourself no molten gods."

[EXO34:18] "You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  for seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt."

[EXO34:19] "The first offspring from every womb belongs to Me, an all your male livestock, the first offspring from cattle and sheep."

[EXO34:20] "And you shall redeem with a lamb the first offspring from the donkey; and if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck.  You shall redeem all the first-born of your sons.  And none shall appear before Me empty-handed."

[EXO34:21] "You shall work six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during plowing time and harvest you shall rest."

[EXO34:22] "And you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks, that is, the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of the Ingathering at the turn of the year."

[EXO34:23] "Three times a year all your males are to appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel."

[EXO34:24] "For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no man shall covet your land when you go up three times a rear to appear before the LORD your God."

[EXO34:25] "You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor is the sacrifice of Feast of the Passover to be left over until morning."

[EXO34:26] "You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your soil into the hose of the LORD your God.  Your shall no boil a kid in its mother's milk."

[EXO34:27] Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."

[EXO34:28] So he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread or drink water.  And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments."

[EXO34:29] And it came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses' hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him.

[EXO34:30] So when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.

[EXO34:31] Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers in the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.

[EXO34:32] And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he commanded them to do everything that the LORD had spoken to him on Mount Sinai.

[EXO34:33] When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.

[EXO34:34] but whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out; and whenever he came out and spoke to the sons of Israel what he had been commanded,

[EXO34:35] the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone.  So Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with Him.

EXODUS CHAPTER 35

[EXO35:1] Then Moses assembled all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and said to them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do."

[EXO35:2] "For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy day, a sabbath of complete rest to the LORD; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death."

[EXO35:3] "You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwelling on the sabbath day."

[EXO35:4] And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying,

[EXO35:5] 'Take from among you a contribution to the LORD; whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as the LORD's contribution: gold, silver, and bronze,

[EXO35:6] and blue, purple and scarlet material, fine linen, goats' hair,

[EXO35:7] and rams' skins dyed red, and porpoise skins, and acacia wood,

[EXO35:8] and oil for lighting, and spices for the anointing oil, an for the fragrant incense,

[EXO35:9] and the onyx stones and setting stones, for the ephod and for the breast piece.'

[EXO35:10] 'And let every skillful man among you come, and make all that the LORD has commanded:

[EXO35:11] the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, it hooks and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;

[EXO35:12] the ark and its poles, the mercy seat, and the curtain of the screen;

[EXO35:13] the table and its poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;

[EXO35:14] the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps and the oil for the light;

[EXO35:15] and the altar of incense and its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle;

[EXO35:16] the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand;

[EXO35:17] the hangings of the court, it pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;

[EXO35:18] the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords;

[EXO35:19] the woven garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.'"

[EXO35:20] Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from Moses' presence.

[EXO35:21] And everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the LORD's contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments.

[EXO35:22] Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and bracelets, all articles of gold; so did every man who presented an offering of gold to the LORD.

[EXO35:23] And every man, who had in his possession blue and purple and scarlet material and fine linen and goats' hair and ram's skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them.

[EXO35:24] Everyone who could make a contribution of silver and bronze brought the LORD's contribution; and every man, who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.

[EXO35:25] And all the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, in blue an purple and scarlet material and in fine linen.

[EXO35:26] And all the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' hair.

[EXO35:27] And the rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece;

[EXO35:28] and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.

[EXO35:29] The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring material for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD.

[EXO35:30] Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, "See, the LORD had called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."

[EXO35:31] "And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship;

[EXO35:32] to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze,

[EXO35:33] and in the cutting of stones for settings an in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work."

[EXO35:34] "He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan."

[EXO35:35] "He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs."

EXODUS CHAPTER 36

[EXO36:1] "Now Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skillful person in whom the LORD has put skill and understanding to know how to perform all the work in the construction of the sanctuary, shall perform in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded."

[EXO36:2] Then Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skillful person in whom the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to the work to perform it.

[EXO36:3] And they received from Moses all the contributions which the sons of Israel had brought to perform the work in the construction of the sanctuary.  And they still continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.

[EXO36:4] And all the skillful men who were performing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work which he was performing,

[EXO36:5] and they said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the LORD commanded us to perform."

[EXO36:6] So Moses issued a command, and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary."  Thus the people were restrained from bringing any more.

[EXO36:7] For the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work, to perform it.

[EXO36:8] And all the skillful men among those who were performing the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet material, with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman, Bezalel make them.

[EXO36:9] The length of each curtain was twenty eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains had the same measurements.

[EXO36:10] And he joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.

[EXO36:11] And he made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he did likewise on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.

[EXO36:12] He made fifty loops in the one curtain and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set; the loops were opposite each other.

[EXO36:13] And he made fifty clasps of gold, and joined the curtains to one another with the clasps, so the tabernacle was a unit.

[EXO36:14] Then he made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all.

[EXO36:15] The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the width of each curtain; the eleven curtains had the same measurements.

[EXO36:16] And he joined five curtains by themselves, and the other six curtains by themselves.

[EXO36:17] Moreover, he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the first set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set.

[EXO36:18] And he made fifty clasps of bronze to join the tent together, that it might be a unit.

[EXO36:19] And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of porpoise skins above.

[EXO36:20] Then he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.

[EXO36:21] Ten cubits was the length of each board, and one and a half cubits the width of each board.

[EXO36:22] There were two tenons for each board, fitted to one another; thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle.

[EXO36:23] And he made the boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side;

[EXO36:24] and he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.

[EXO36:25] Then for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards, 

[EXO36:26] and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board and two sockets under another board.

[EXO36:27] And for the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six boards

[EXO36:28] And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear.

[EXO36:29] And they were double beneath, and together they were complete to its top to the first ring; thus he did with both of them for the two corners.

[EXO36:30] And there were eight boards with their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two under every board.

[EXO36:31] Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle,

[EXO36:32] and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the rear side to the west.

[EXO36:33] And he made the middle bar to pass through in the center of the boards from end to end.

[EXO36:34] And he overlaid the boards with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

[EXO36:35] Moreover, he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen; he make it with cherubim, the work of a skillful workman.

[EXO36:36] And he made four pillars of acacia wood for it, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.

[EXO36:37] And he made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver;

[EXO36:38] and he made its five pillars with their hooks, and he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold; but their five sockets were of bronze.

EXODUS CHAPTER 37

[EXO37:1] Now Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits;

[EXO37:2] and he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a gold molding for it all around.

[EXO37:3] And he cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet; even two rings on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.

[EXO37:4] And he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

[EXO37:5] And he put the poles into the rings on the side of the ark, to carry it.

[EXO37:6] And he made a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide.

[EXO37:7] And he made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work, at the two ends of the mercy seat;

[EXO37:8] one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at the two ends.

[EXO37:9] And the cherubim had their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.

[EXO37:10] Then he made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.

[EXO37:11] And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding for it all around.

[EXO37:12] And he made a rim for it of a handbreadth all around and made a gold molding for its rim all around.

[EXO37:13] And he cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners that were on its four feet.

[EXO37:14] Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles to carry the table.

[EXO37:15] And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.

[EXO37:16] And he made the utensils which were on the table, its dishes and its pans and its bowls and its jars, with which to pour out libations, of pure gold.

[EXO37:17] Then he made the lampstand of pure gold.  He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its shaft; its cups, its bulbs and its flowers were of one piece with it.

[EXO37:18] And there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand from the one side of it, and three branches of the lampstand from the other side of it;

[EXO37:19] three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in one branch , and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a bulb and a flower in the other branch--so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.

[EXO37:20] And in the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, its bulbs and its flower;

[EXO37:21] and a bulb was under the first pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the second pair of branches coming out of it, and a bulb under the third pair of branches coming out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand.

[EXO37:22] Their bulbs and their branches were of one piece with it; the whole of it was a single hammered work of pure gold.

[EXO37:23] And he made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.

[EXO37:24] He made it and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.

[EXO37:25] Then he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high ; its horns were of one piece with it.

[EXO37:26] And he overlaid it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and he made a gold molding for it all around.

[EXO37:27] And he made two golden rings for it under its molding, on its two sides--on opposite sides-- as holders for poles with which to carry it.

[EXO37:28] And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

[EXO37:29] And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.

EXODUS CHAPTER 38

[EXO38:1] Then he made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, square, and three cubits high.

[EXO38:2] And he made its horns on its four corners, its horns being of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze.

[EXO38:3] And he made all the utensils of the altar, the pails and the shovels and the basins, the flesh hooks and the firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze.

[EXO38:4] And he made for the altar a grating of bronze network beneath, under its ledge, reaching halfway up.

[EXO38:5] And he cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze grating as holders for the poles.

[EXO38:6] And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.

[EXO38:7] And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it.  He made it hollow with planks.

[EXO38:8] Moreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the door way of the tent of meeting.

[EXO38:9] The he made the court: for the south side the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits;

[EXO38:10] their twenty pillars, and their twenty sockets, made of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.

[EXO38:11] And for the north side there were one hundred cubits; their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets were of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.

[EXO38:12] And for the west side there were hangings of fifty cubits with their ten pillars and their ten sockets; the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.

[EXO38:13] And for the east side fifty cubits.

[EXO38:14] The hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets,

[EXO38:15] and so for the other side.  On both sides of the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.

[EXO38:16] All the hangings of the court all around were of fine twisted linen.

[EXO38:17] And the sockets for the pillars were of bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands, of silver; and the overlaying of their tops, of silver, and all the pillars of the court were furnished with silver bands.

[EXO38:18] And the screen of the gate of the court was the work of the weaver, of blue and purple an scarlet material, and fine twisted linen.  And the length was twenty cubits and the height was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.

[EXO38:19] And their four pillars and their four sockets were of bronze; their hooks were of silver, and the overlaying of their tops and their bands were of silver.

[EXO38:20] And all the pegs of the tabernacle and the court all around were of bronze.

[EXO38:21] This is the number of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were numbered according to the command of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.

[EXO38:22] Now Bezalel, the son of Uri the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO38:23] And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful workman and a weaver in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and fine linen.

[EXO38:24] All the gold that was used for the work, in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the wave offering, was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;

[EXO38:25] And the silver of those of the congregation who were numbered was 100 talents and 1,755 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;

[EXO38:26] a beka a head (that is, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary), for each one who passed over to those were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,550 men.

[EXO38:27] And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil; one hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

[EXO38:28] And of the 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the pillars and overlaid their tops and made bands for them.

[EXO38:29] And the bronze of the wave offering was 70 talents, and 2,400 shekels.

[EXO38:30] And with it he made the sockets to the doorway of the tent of meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar,

[EXO38:31] and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs of the court all around.

EXODUS CHAPTER 39

[EXO39:1] Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet material, they made finely woven garments for ministering in the holy place, as well as the holy garments which were for Aaron, just the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:2] And he made the ephod of gold, and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen.

[EXO39:3] Then they hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads to be woven in with the blue and the purple and the scarlet material, and fine linen, the work of a skillful workman.

[EXO39:4] They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two upper ends.

[EXO39:5] And the skillfully woven band which was on it was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material, and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:6] And they made the onyx stones, set in gold filigree settings; they were engraved like the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the sons of Israel.

[EXO39:7] And he placed them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:8] And he made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful workman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue and purple and scarlet material and fine twisted linen.

[EXO39:9] It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a span long and a span wide when folded double.

[EXO39:10] And they mounted four rows of stones on it.  the first row was a row of ruby, topaz and emerald;

[EXO39:11] and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire and a diamond;

[EXO39:12] and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;

[EXO39:13] and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper.  They were set in gold filigree settings when they were mounted.

[EXO39:14] And the stones were corresponding to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve, corresponding to their names, engraved with the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes.

[EXO39:15] And they made on the breastpiece chains like cords, of twisted cordage work in pure gold.

[EXO39:16] And they made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece.

[EXO39:17] Then they put the two gold cords in the two rings at the ends of the breast piece.

[EXO39:18] And they put the other two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulders pieces of the ephod at the front of it.

[EXO39:19] and they made two gold rings and placed them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod.

[EXO39:20] Furthermore, they made two gold rings and placed them on the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front of it, close to the place where it joined, above the woven band of the ephod.

[EXO39:21] And they bound the breast piece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, that it might be on the woven band of the ephod, and that the breastpiece might not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:22] Then he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;

[EXO39:23] and the opening of the robe was at the top in the center, as the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding all around its opening, that it might not be torn.

[EXO39:24] And they made pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet material and twisted linen on the hem of the robe.

[EXO39:25] Then also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the hem of the robe,

[EXO39:26] alternating a bell and a pomegranate all around on the hem of the robe, for the service, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:27] And they made the tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons,

[EXO39:28] and the turban of fine linen, and the decorated caps of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twisted linen,

[EXO39:29] and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue and purple and scarlet material, the work of the weaver, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:30] And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and inscribed it like the engravings of a signet, "Holy to the LORD."

[EXO39:31] And they fastened a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:32] Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was completed; and the sons of Israel did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; so they did.

[EXO39:33] And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings: its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars and its sockets;

[EXO39:34] and the covering of ram's skins dyed red, and the covering of porpoise skins, and the screening veil;

[EXO39:35] the ark of the testimony and its poles and the mercy seat;

[EXO39:36] the table, all its utensils, an the bread of the Presence;

[EXO39:37] the pure gold lampstand, with its arrangement of lamps and all its utensils, and the oil for the light;

[EXO39:38] and the gold altar, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and  the veil for the doorway of the tent;

[EXO39:39] the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils, the laver and its stand;

[EXO39:40] the hangings for the court, its pillars and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, its cords and its pegs and all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;

[EXO39:41] the woven garments for ministering in the holy place and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to minister as priests.

[EXO39:42] So the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO39:43] And Moses examined all the work and behold, they had done it; just the LORD had commanded, this they had done.  So Moses blessed them.

EXODUS CHAPTER 40

[EXO40:1] Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,

[EXO40:2] "On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting."

[EXO40:3] "And you shall place the ark of the testimony there, and you shall screen the ark with the veil."

[EXO40:4] "And you shall bring in the table and arrange what belongs on it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and mount its lamps."

[EXO40:5] "Moreover, you shall set the gold altar of incense before the ark of the testimony, and set up the veil for the doorway to the tabernacle."

[EXO40:6] "And you shall set the altar of burn offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting."

[EXO40:7] "And you shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it."

[EXO40:8] "And you shall set up the court all around and hang up the veil for the gateway of the court."

[EXO40:9] "Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall consecrate it and all its furnishings; and it shall be holy."

[EXO40:10] "And you shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar; and the altar shall be most holy"

[EXO40:11] "And you shall anoint the laver and its stand, and consecrate it."

[EXO40:12] "Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the tent of meeting and wash them with water."

[EXO40:13] "And you shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may minister as priest to Me."

[EXO40:14] "And you shall bring his sons and put tunics on them;

[EXO40:15] and you shall anoint them even as you have anointed their father, that they may minister as priest to Me; and their anointing shall qualify them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations."

[EXO40:16] Thus Moses did; according to all that the LORD had commanded him, so he did.

[EXO40:17] Now it came about in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was erected.

[EXO40:18] And Moses erected the tabernacle and laid its sockets, an set up its boards, and inserted its bars and erected its pillars.

[EXO40:19] And he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:20] Then he took the testimony and put it into the ark, and attacked the poles to the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark.

[EXO40:21] And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:22] Then he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.

[EXO40:23] And he set the arrangement of bread in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:24] Then he placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle.

[EXO40:25] And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:26] Then he placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil;

[EXO40:27] and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:28] Then he set up the veil for the doorway of the tabernacle.

[EXO40:29] And he set the altar of burnt offering before the doorway of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:30] Ad the placed the laver between the tent o meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing.

[EXO40:31] And from it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hand s and their feet.

[EXO40:32] When they entered the tent of meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.

[EXO40:33] And he erected the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, ad hung up the veil for the gateway of the court.  Thus Moses finished the work.

[EXO40:34] Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

[EXO40:35] And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because of the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

[EXO40:36] And throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel would set out;

[EXO40:37] but it the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day when it was taken up.

[EXO40:38] For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel.
