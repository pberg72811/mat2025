Deuteronomy CHAPTER 1

[DEU1:1] These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.

[DEU1:2] It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadeshbarnea.

[DEU1:3] In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had commanded him to give to them,

[DEU1:4] after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.

[DEU1:5] Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this law, saying,

[DEU1:6] "The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain.  

[DEU1:7] Turn and set your journey, and go to to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negev and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.  

[DEU1:8] See, I have placed the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to them and their descendants after them.'

[DEU1:9] "I spoke to you at the time, saying, 'I am not able to bear the burden of you alone.'

[DEU1:10] 'The LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day like the stars of heaven in number.'  

[DEU1:11] 'May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand-fold more than you are and bless you just as He has promised you!' 

[DEU1:12] 'How can I alone bear the load and burden of you and your strife?'

[DEU1:13] 'Choose wise and discerning and experienced men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.'  

[DEU1:14] "You answered me and said, 'The thing which you have said is good.'" 

[DEU1:15] "So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and appointed them heads over you, leaders of thousands and of hundreds, and of fifties and of tens, and officers for your tribes."

[DEU1:15] "Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman, or the alien who is with him.' 

[DEU1:15] 'You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike.  You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God's.  The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'"

[DEU1:15] "I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do."

[DEU1:16] "Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear the cases between your fellow countrymen, and judge righteously between a man and his fellow countryman, or the alien who is with him.'"

[DEU1:17] "'You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike.  You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God's.  The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'"

[DEU1:18] "I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do."

[DEU1:19] "Then we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea."

[DEU1:20] "I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the LORD our God is about to give us.'"

[DEU1:21] "'See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you; go up take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you.  Do not fear or be dismayed.'"

[DEU1:22] "Then all of you approached me and said, 'Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we should go up and the cities which we shall enter.'" 

[DEU1:23] "The thing pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man for each tribe."

[DEU1:24] "They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol and spied it out."

[DEU1:25] "Then they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought us back a report and said, 'It is a good land which the LORD our God is about to give us.'"

[DEU1:26] "Yet you were not willing to go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;

[DEU1:27] and you grumbled in your tents and said, 'Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.'"

[DEU1:28] "'Where can we go up?  Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are bigger and taller then we; the cities are large and fortified to heaven.  And besides, we saw the sons of the Anakim there."'"

[DEU1:29] "Then I said to you, 'Do not be shocked, nor fear them.'"  

[DEU1:30] "'The LORD your God who goes before you will Himself fight on your behalf, just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 

[DEU1:31] and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried you, just as a man carries his son, in all the way which you have walked until you came to this place.'"

[DEU1:32] "But for all this, you did not trust the LORD your God,

[DEU1:33] who goes before you on your way, to seek a place for you to encamp, in fire by night and cloud by day, to show you the way in which you should go."

[DEU1:34] "Then the LORD heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and took an oath, saying,

[DEU1:35] 'Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore to give your fathers, 

[DEU1:36] except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his sons I will give the land on which he has set foot, because he has followed the LORD fully.'"

[DEU1:37] "The LORD was angry with me also on your account, saying, 'Not even you shall enter there.'"

[DEU1:38] "'Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there; encourage him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it.'"

[DEU1:39] "'Moreover, your little ones who you said would become a prey, and your sons, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter there, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it.'"

[DEU1:40] "'But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.'"

[DEU1:41] "Then you said to me, 'We have sinned against the LORD; we will indeed go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.'  And every man of you girded on his weapons of war, and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country."  

[DEU1:42] "And the LORD said to me, 'Say to them, "Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; otherwise you will be defeated before your enemies."'" 

[DEU1:43] "So I spoke to you, but you would not listen.  Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country."

[DEU1:44] "The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah."

[DEU1:45] "Then you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not listen to your voice nor give ear to you."

[DEU1:46] "So you remained in Kadesh many days, the days that you spent there."

Deuteronomy CHAPTER 2

[DEU2:1] "Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as the LORD spoke to me, and circled Mount Seir for many days."

[DEU2:2] "And the LORD spoke to me, saying,

[DEU2:3] 'You have circled this mountain long enough.  Now turn north, 

[DEU2:4] and command the people, saying, " You will pass through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you.  So be very careful;

[DEU2:5] do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, even as little as a footstep because I have given Mount Sir to Esau as a possession."'"

[DEU2:6] "'"You shall by food from them with money so that you may eat, and you shall also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink."'" 

[DEU2:7] "'"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has known your wanderings through this great wilderness.  These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing."'"

[DEU2:8] "So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and from Eziongeber.  And we turned and passed through by the way of the wilderness of Moab."

[DEU2:9] "Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.'" 

[DEU2:10] (The Emim lived there formerly, a people as great, numerous and tall as the Anakim.  

[DEU2:11] Like the Anakim, they are also regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.  

[DEU2:12] The Horites formerly lived in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did to the land of their possession which the LORD gave to them.)

[DEU2:13] "'Now arise and cross over the brook Zered yourselves.'  So we crossed over the brook Zered."

[DEU2:14] "Now the time that it took for us to come from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men of war perished from within the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them." 

[DEU2:15] "Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp until they all perished."

[DEU2:16] "So it came about when all the men of war had finally perished from amoung the people,

[DEU2:17] that the LORD spoke to me, saying, 

[DEU2:18] 'Today you shall cross over Ar, the border of Moab.  

[DEU2:19] When you come opposite the sons of Ammon, do not harm them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.' 

[DEU2:20] (it is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim formerly lived in it, but Ammonites call them Zamzummin, 

[DEU2:21] a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed the before them,  And they dispossessed them and settled in their place, 

[DEU2:22] just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.  

[DEU2:23] And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and lived in their place." 

[DEU2:24] 'Arise, set out, and passed through the valley of Arnon.  Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession and contend with him in battle.

[DEU2:25] This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples every where under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you will tremble and be in anguish because of you.' 

[DEU2:26] "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Dedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 

[DEU2:27] 'Let me pass through your land, I will travel only on the highway; I will not turn aside to the right of to the left.'  

[DEU2:28] 'You will sell me food for money so that I may eat, and give me water for money so that I may drink, only let me pass through on foot, 

[DEU2:29] just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I cross over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God is giving to us.'"

[DEU2:30] "But Sihon king of Heshbon was willing for us to pass through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to deliver him into your hand, as he is today."

[DEU2:31] "The LORD said to me, 'See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you.  Begin to occupy, that you may possess his land.'"

[DEU2:32] "Then Sihon with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz."

[DEU2:33] "The LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him with his sons and all his people." 

[DEU2:34] "So we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men, women and children of every city.  We left no survivor.  

[DEU2:35] "We took only the animals as our booty and the spoil of the cities which we had captured." 

[DEU2:36] "From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon and from the city which in in the valley, even to Gilead, there was no city that was too high for us; the LORD our God delivered all over to us." 

[DEU2:37] "Only you did not go near to the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had commanded us."

Deuteronomy CHAPTER 3

[DEU3:1] "Then we tunred and went up the road to Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, with all his people came out to meet us in battle at Edrei."

[DEU3:2] But the Lord said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'"

[DEU3:3] "So the LORD our God delivered Og also, king of Bashan, with all his people into our hand, and we smote them until no survivor was left."

[DEU3:4] "We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kindom of Og in Bashan."

[DEU3:5] "All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates and bars, besides a great many unwalled towns."

[DEU3:6] "We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women and children of every city."

[DEU3:7] "But all the animals and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty."

[DEU3:8] Thus we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who where beyond the Jordan, from the valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon

[DEU3:9] (Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir):

[DEU3:10] all the cities of the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far a Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kindom of Og in Bashan.

[DEU3:11] (For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim.  Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead; it is in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon.  Its length was nine cubits and its width four cubits by ordinary cubit.)

[DEU3:12] "So we took possession of this land at that time.  From Aroer, which is by the valley of Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead and its cities I gave  to the Reubenites and to the Gadites."

[DEU3:13] "The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kindom of Og, I gave to the the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim.

[DEU3:14] Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called it, that is, Bashan, after his own name , Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)"

[DEU3:15] "To Machir I gave Gilead."

[DEU3:16] "To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even as far as the valley of Arnon, the middle of the valley as a border and as far as the river Jabbok, the border of the sons of Ammon;

[DEU3:17] the Arabah also, with the Jordan as a border, from Chinnereth even as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east."

[DEU3:18] "Then I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it; all you valiant men shall cross over armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel.'"

[DEU3:19] "'But your wives and your little ones and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you, 

[DEU3:20] until the LORD gives rest to your fellow countrymen as to you, they also possess the land which the LORD your God will give them beyond the Jordan.  Then you may return every man to his possession which I have given you.'"

[DEU3:21] "I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.'"

[DEU3:22] "'Do not fear them, for the LORD your God is the one fighting for you.'"

[DEU3:23] "I also pleaded with the LORD at time, saying,

[DEU3:24] 'O LORD GOD, you have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as Yours?'"

[DEU3:25] "'Let me, I pray, cross over and see the fair land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'"

[DEU3:26] "But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me; and the LORD said to me, 'Enough! Speak to Me no more of this matter.'"

[DEU3:27] "'Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes to the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.'"

[DEU3:28] "'But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he will give them as an inheritance the land which you will see.'"

[DEU3:29] "So we remained in the valley opposite Bethpeor."

Deuteronomy CHAPTER 4

[DEU4:1] "Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to perform, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you."

[DEU4:2] "You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you."

[DEU4:3] "Your eyes have seen what the LORD has done in the case of Baal-peor, for all the men who followed Baal-peor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you."

[DEU4:4] "But you who held fast to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you."

[DEU4:5] "See, I have taught you statues and judgments just as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do thus in the land where you are entering to possess it."

[DEU4:6] "So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'"

[DEU4:7] "For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as is the LORD our God whenever we call on Him?"

[DEU4:8] Or what great nation is there that has statues and judgments as righteous as this whole law which I am setting before you today?"

[DEU4:9] "Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your sons and your grandsons."

[DEU4:10] "Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when the LORD said to me, 'Assemble the people to me, that I may let them hear My words so they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.'"

[DEU4:11] "You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the very heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud and thick gloom."

[DEU4:12] "Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form- only a voice."

[DEU4:13] "So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone."

[DEU4:14] "The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might perform them in the land where you are going over to possess it."

[DEU4:15] "So watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire, 

[DEU4:16] so that you do not act corruptly and make a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

[DEU4:17] the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,

[DEU4:18] the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water below the earth."

[DEU4:19] "And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven." 

[DEU4:20] "But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, from Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as today."

[DEU4:21] "Now the LORD was angry with me on your account, and swore that I would not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance."

[DEU4:22] "For I will die in this land, I shall not cross the Jordan, but you shall cross and take possession of this good land."

[DEU4:23] "So watch yourselves, that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image in the form of anything against which the LORD your God as commanded you."

[DEU4:24] "For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God."

[DEU4:25] "When you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land, and act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD you God so as to provoke Him to anger, 

[DEU4:26] "I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it.  You shall not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed."

[DEU4:27] "The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you."

[DEU4:21] "There you will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell."

[DEU4:22] "But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul."

[DEU4:23] "When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice."

[DEU4:24] "For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them."

[DEU4:25] "When you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land, and act corruptly, and make an idol in the form of anything, and do that which is evil in the sight of the LORD your God so as to provoke Him to anger,

[DEU4:26] I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it. You shall not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed."

[DEU4:27] "The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you." 

[DEU4:28] "There you will serve gods, the work of man's hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell."

[DEU4:29] "But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul."

[DEU4:30] "When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice."

[DEU4:31] "For the LORD your God is a compassionate God; He will not fail you nor destroy you nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them."

[DEU4:32] "Indeed, ask now concerning the former days which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and inquire from one end of the heavens to the other.  Has anything been done like this great thing, or has anything been heard like it?

[DEU4:33] "Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard it, and survived?"

[DEU4:34]  Or has a god tried to go to take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a might hand and by ans outstretched arm and by great terrors, ans the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"

[DEU4:35] "To you it was shown that you might know that the LORD, He is God; there is no other besides Him."

[DEU4:36] "Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire."

[DEU4:37] "Because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them.  And He personally brought you from Egypt by His great power,

[DEU4:38] driving out from before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in and to give you their land for an inheritance, as it it today."

[DEU4:39] "Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other."

[DEU4:40] "So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am giving you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time."

[DEU4:41] Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east, 

[DEU4:42] that a manslayer might flee there, who unintentionally slew his neighbor without having enmity toward him in time past; and by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:

[DEU4:43] Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.

[DEU4:44] Now this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel; 

[DEU4:45] these are the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when the came out from Egypt,

[DEU4:46] across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt.

[DEU4:47] They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan to the east,

[DEU4:48] from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, even as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),

[DEU4:49] with all the Arabah across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.


Deuteronomy CHAPTER 5

[DEU5:01] Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I am speaking today in your hearing, that you may learn them and observe them carefully."

[DEU5:02] "The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.

[DEU5:03] The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, with all those of us alive here today.

[DEU5:04] The LORD spoke to you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the fire,

[DEU5:05] while I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain.  He said,

[DEU5:06] 'I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.'

[DEU5:07] 'You shall have no other gods before Me.'

[DEU5:08] 'You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.'

[DEU5:09] 'You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,

[DEU5:10] but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those you love Me and keep My commandments.'

[DEU5:11] 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.'

[DEU5:12] 'Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy, as the LORD your God commanded you.

[DEU5:13] 'Six days you shall labor and do all your work,

[DEU5:14] 'but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you , so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.'

[DEU5:15] 'You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a might hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day.'

[DEU5:16] 'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you on the land which the LORD your God gives you.'

[DEU5:17] 'You shall not murder.'

[DEU5:18] 'You shall not commit adultery.'

[DEU5:19] 'You shall not steal.'

[DEU5:20] 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

[DEU5:21] 'You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, and you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field or his male servant or his female servant, his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.'"

[DEU5:22] "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud and of the thick gloom, with a great voice, and he added no more.  He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me."

[DEU5:23] "And when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders."

[DEU5:24]  "You said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he lives.'

[DEU5:25] 'Now then why should we die?  For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, then we will die.'

[DEU5:26] 'For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?'

[DEU5:27] 'Go near and hear all that the LORD our God says; then speak to us all that the LORD our God speaks to you, and we will hear and do it.'"

[DEU5:28] "The LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you.  They have done well in all that they have spoken.'

[DEU5:29]  'Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear Me and keep all My commandments always, that it may be well with them and with their sons forever!'

[DEU5:30] Go, say to them, "Return to your tents."

[DEU5:31] "But as for you stand here by Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may observe them in the land which I give them to possess.'

[DEU5:32] 'So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.'

[DEU5:33]  'You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you will possess.'

Deuteronomy CHAPTER 6

[DEU6:1] "Now this is the commandment, the statues and the judgments which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess it,

[DEU6:2] so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the LORD your God, to keep all His statues and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged."

[DEU6:3] "O Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that i may be well with you and that you may multiply greatly, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey."

[DEU6:4] "Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!"

[DEU6:5] "You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might."

[DEU6:6] "These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart."

[DEU6:7] "You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house ans when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up."

[DEU6:8] "You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead."

[DEU6:9] "You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."
