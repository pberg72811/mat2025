To create a patch file.

    diff -Naur oldDirectory newDirectory > patch-oldDirectory-to-newDirectory

Flag explanation for the "diff" command:
-N
--new-file
       In directory comparison, if a file is found in only  one  directory, 
       treat it as present but empty in the other directory.

-a     Treat  all  files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they
       do not seem to be text.

-u     Use the unified output format.

-r     When comparing directories, recursively compare any  subdirectories
       found.

For complete discription see manual pages for "diff" command.

    man diff
