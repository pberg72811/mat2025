    Official</font></a> <font color="#0000A0" face="arial, helvetica"> Use Only (FOUO)<br>
    And Similar Designations</font></h1>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">For Official Use Only (FOUO) is a document
    designation, not a classification. This designation is used by Department of Defense and a
    number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which, although
    unclassified, may not be appropriate for public release.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">There is no national policy governing use of
    the For Official Use Only designation. DoD Directive 5400.7 defines For Official Use Only
    information as &quot;unclassified information that may be exempt from mandatory release to
    the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&quot; The policy is implemented by
    DoD Regulation 5400.7-R and 5200.1-R.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="arial, helvetica"><img src="../images/Block.gif" alt="bullet" width="32" height="32">&nbsp;
      <strong><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000">The For Official Use Only designation is also used by CIA and a number of
      other federal agencies, but each agency is responsible for determining how it shall be
      used. The categories of protected information may be quite different from one agency to
      another, although in every case the protected information must be covered by one of the
      nine categories of information that are <a href="Foia.htm#Freedom">exempt from public
      release under FOIA</a>.</font></strong></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">Some agencies use different terminology for
    the same types of information. For example, Department of Energy uses Official Use Only
    (OUO). Department of State uses Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), formerly called Limited
    Official Use (LOU). The Drug Enforcement Administration uses DEA Sensitive. In all cases
    the designations refer to unclassified, sensitive information that is or may be exempt
    from public release under the Freedom of Information Act.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">The fact that information is marked FOUO does
    not mean it is automatically exempt from public release under FOIA. If a request for the
    information is received, it must be reviewed to see if it meets the FOIA dual test: (1) It
    fits into one of the nine FOIA exemption categories, and (2) There is a legitimate
    government purpose served by withholding the information. On the other hand, the absence
    of the FOUO or other marking does not automatically mean the information must be released
    in response to a FOIA request.</font></p>
    <h2><em><font color="#0000A0" face="arial, helvetica">Statutory/Regulatory
    Responsibilities &amp; Obligations</font></em></h2>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">Each government department or agency defines
    what information shall be protected and how its protected information shall be handled.
    The following information pertains only to Department of Defense FOUO information. When
    dealing with sensitive but unclassified information from another department or agency,
    check with the originator regarding appropriate handling.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#0000A0">Access to FOUO
    Information</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">FOUO information may be disseminated within
    the DoD components and between officials of the DoD components and DoD contractors,
    consultants, and grantees as necessary in the conduct of official business. FOUO
    information may also be released to officials in other departments and agencies of the
    executive and judicial branches in performance of a valid government function.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#0000A0">Marking FOUO Information</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">Unclassified documents and material
    containing FOUO information shall be marked as follows:</font><ul>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Documents will be marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
        at the bottom of the front cover (if there is one), the title page (if there is one), the
        first page, and the outside of the back cover (if there is one).</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Pages of the document that contain FOUO
        information shall be marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY at the bottom.-</font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Each paragraph containing FOUO
        information shall be marked with the abbreviation FOUO in parentheses at
        the beginning of the FOUO portion.<a href="#1.">1</a></font></li>
      <li><font face="arial, helvetica">Material other than paper documents (for
        example, slides, computer media, films, etc.) shall bear markings which alert the holder
        or viewer that the material contains FOUO information.</font></li>
      <li><p align="left"><font face="arial, helvetica">FOUO documents and material
        transmitted outside the Department of Defense must bear an expanded marking on the face of
        the document so that non-DoD holders understand the status of the information. A statement
        similar to this one should be used:</font></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center"><font face="arial, helvetica">This document contains
    information exempt<br>
    from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA.<br>
    Exemption(s) _ apply.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="arial, helvetica">When FOUO information is
    contained within a classified document, the same rules apply except that
    full pages that contain FOUO information
    but no classified information shall be marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY at both the top and bottom
    of the page.</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#0000A0">Safeguarding FOUO Information</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">FOUO information should be handled in a
    manner that provides reasonable assurance that unauthorized persons do not gain access.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">During working hours, reasonable steps should
    be taken to minimize risk of access by unauthorized personnel. After working hours, FOUO
    may be stored as a minimum in unlocked containers, desks or cabinets if government or
    government-contract building security is provided. If government or government-contract
    building security is not provided, it must be stored at a minimum in a locked desk, file
    cabinet, bookcase, locked room, or similar place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">FOUO documents and material may be
    transmitted via first class mail, parcel post, or -- for bulk shipments -- fourth class
    mail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">Fax or e-mail transmission of FOUO
    information (voice, data or facsimile) should be by encrypted communications systems
    whenever practical. FOUO information may be put on an Internet web site only if access to
    the site is limited to a specific target audience and the information is encrypted. See <a href="Website.htm#Pre-Publication">Pre-Publication Review of Web Site Content</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">FOUO documents may be destroyed by shredding
    or tearing into pieces and discarding the pieces in a regular trash container unless
    circumstances suggest a need for more careful protection.</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#0000A0">Enforcement</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica">Administrative penalties may be imposed for
    misuse of FOUO information. Criminal penalties may be imposed depending on the actual
    content of the information (privacy, export control, etc.).</font></p>
