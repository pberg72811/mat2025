The configuration file of Xorg is called "xorg.conf" and it resides in
"/etc/X11"

The man page can be accessed by

    man 5 xorg.conf

Xorg itself is able to guess most parameters for you.  In most cases, you will
only have to change some lines to get the resolution you want up and running.

    Xorg -configure

Alternatives

    xorgconfig

    xorgcfg

    xorgcfg -textmode

If you feel that the screen resolution is wrong, you will need to check two
sections in your configuration.  First of all, you have Screen section which
lists the resolutions, if any that your X server will run at.  by default, this
section might not list any resolutions at all.  If this is the case, Xorg will
estimate the resolution based on the information in the second section, Monitor.

What happens is that Xorg checks the settings of HorizSync and VertRefresh in
the Monitor section to compute valid resolutions.  For now, leave these settings
as-is.  Only when the changes to the Screen section (which we will describe in a
minute) don't work, then you will need to look up the specs for your monitor and
fill in the correct values.  You can also use a tool that searches for your
monitor's specs, such as "sys-apps/ddcxinfo-knoppix"

Warning: Do  not "just" change the values of these two monitor related variables
without consulting the technical specifications of your monitor.  Setting
incorrect values lead to out-of-sync errors at best and smoked up screens at
worst.

Now let us change the resolutions.  In the next example from /etc/X11/xorg.conf
we add the "Modes" lines and the "DefaultDepth" so that our X server starts with
24 bits at 1024x768 by default.  Don't mind the given strings--they are examples
and will most likely differ from the settings on your system.

  Section "Screen"
    Identifier   "Default Screen"
    Device       "S3 Inc. ProSavage KN133 [Twister K]"
    Monitor      "Generic Monitor"
    DefaultDepth 24
  
    SubSection "Display"
      Depth 24
      Modes "1024x768"
    EndSubSection

  EndSection

Run X (startx) to discover if it uses the resolution you want.

Configure your Keyboard

To setup X to use an international keyboard, search for the InputDevice section
that configures the keyboard and add the XkbLayout option to point to the
keyboard layout you want.  As an example, we show you how to apply for the
Belgian layout.  Just substitute the country-keycode with yours:

  Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "Generic Keyboard"
    Driver     "keyboard"
    Option     "CoreKeyboard"
    Option     "XkbRules"  "xorg"
    Option     "XkbModel"  "pc105"
    Option     "XkbLayout" "be"
  EndSection


Configure your mouse

If your mouse isn't working, you will first need to find out if it is detected
by the kernel at all.  Mice are (device-wise) seen as /dev/input/mouse0 (or
/dev/input/mice if you want to use several mice).  In some cases /dev/psaux is
used.  In either case you can check if the devices do represent your mouse by
checking the output of those files when you move your mouse.  You will usually
see some junk on your screen.  To end the session press "ctrl-c".

    cat /dev/input/mouse0

If your mouse isn't detected, verify if all the necessary modules are loaded.

If your mouse is detected, fill in the device in the appropriate InputDevice
section.  In the next example you'll see we also set two other options: Protocol
(which lists the mouse protocol to be used -- most users will use PS/2 or
IMPS/2) and ZAxmisMapping (which allows for the mousewheel (if applicable) to 
be used).

  Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier "TouchPad Mouse"
    Driver     "mouse"
    Option     "CorePointer"
    Option     "Device" "/dev/input/mouse0"
    Option     "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
    Option     "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
  EndSection

Run startx and be happy about the result.
